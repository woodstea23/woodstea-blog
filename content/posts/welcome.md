title = 'In which a 59 year old data science grad student finds his way'
+++
Coming up in September I have the fifth course of twelve in the data science
master's program at the Harvard Extension School. It's CSCI E-89, Deep Learning.
Between now and then I have a little time to brush up on some things I'll need
for that:
 
- Introductory deep learning concepts so I'm not going in cold
- Math for deep learning: linear algebra, MV calc...?
- Python/pandas practice

I've also just bought a Macbook to replace the 5+ year old Windows laptop that
didn't quite cut it last semester when running ensemble models and which
occasionally just goes dark and has to be shut down hard. So I've got some
work to do getting comfortable with its OS again as well as various tools
I'll be using.

Lately I've been thinking I need to be more deliberate about the things I'm
learning and so here's a blog to help do that.
